# SurrealDB Context MCP Access — Agent Runbook

**Status**: Draft
**Authority**: Issue #2101 / Wave 12 Parent #2091 / Epic #1976
**Scope**: Local/dev only. Document how agents access the Context MCP Bridge layer safely, with read-only semantics and fail-closed guardrails.

This runbook is **not** a production activation guide. It does not authorize live trading, does not change Live-Readiness, and does not enable any write path.

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This runbook describes how agents use the **Context MCP Bridge** (`tools/mcp/`) to access the SurrealDB Context Intelligence System through a read-only MCP-compatible tool layer.

Use cases:
- Search the context knowledge base
- Trace decision and event lineage
- Explain provenance of context sources
- Package context artifacts for agent handoff
- Assess action readiness before starting work
- Resolve stop conditions and required reads
- Generate structured briefings for session start

Out of scope for this runbook:
- Production SurrealDB activation
- Any write operations (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.)
- Trading-state, risk, execution, governance, or runtime state
- Live-trading, Live-Readiness, or Echtgeld authorization
- Context import pipeline (see `surrealdb_context_import.md`)
- Context query CLI (see `surrealdb_context_query.md`)

---

## 1.5. MCP Capability Resolution Protocol

**Before relying on any tool in this runbook, resolve capability explicitly.**

Repo-defined tools are not automatically available to agents. A tool is available
only when the active MCP surface exposes it and invocation dispatches a real handler.

**Capability beats assumption. Repo presence is not MCP availability.**

| Check | Pass criterion | Fail action |
|---|---|---|
| Active MCP inventory | Required tool appears in the active MCP tool list | Stop and report missing surface/config |
| Dispatch | Tool call reaches a real handler | Stop on `unknown_tool` or `not_implemented` |
| Read-only contract | Response reports `metadata.read_only == true` where applicable | Stop and report contract violation |
| DB-backed mode | SurrealDB is accessed only when `adapter_config_path` is explicitly passed | Stop if DB access is implicit |
| Local DB boundary | Remote DB URLs are rejected | Stop and report boundary failure |
| Write/admin guard | Write/admin statements fail closed before network access | Stop and report guard failure |

For repo-native Context MCP access, `claire-de-binare.mcp.json` must expose the
`cdb_context` server entry under the top-level `mcpServers` object:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cdb_context": {
      "enabled": true,
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "tools.mcp.server"],
      "type": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

The MCP host must invoke the server from the repository root so that `tools.*`
module paths resolve correctly.

If any capability check fails:
- Do not switch to a raw/external SurrealDB MCP server.
- Report the exact missing layer.
- Propose the smallest CDB-native read-only fix after Human-GO.

Established by PR #2559 (`a35d7728`). Cross-reference: `cdb-session-start` skill, step 5.

### 1.5.1. Agent MCP Installation Matrix

This matrix defines how every active agent surface accesses the CDB Context MCP.
Repo presence is not MCP availability. Each surface must be verified independently.

**Five-level distinction:**

| Level | Criterion | How to verify |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | Config file exists | `claire-de-binare.mcp.json` present in repo root |
| L2 | Agent host knows config | Host MCP config references `cdb_context` server entry |
| L3 | MCP server starts | L3a: bridge import (`create_bridge()` works); L3b: stdio server import (`import tools.mcp.server` — bounded, no event loop). If bridge works but stdio is blocked by env, report WARN — bridge-level access is available, host integration needs env fix. |
| L4 | Tool inventory exposes target | `context.briefing` appears in active MCP tool list |
| L5 | Actual invocation works | `context.briefing({...})` returns valid response |

**Per-surface status:**

| Agent Surface | L1 Config | L2 Host | L3 Server | L4 Inventory | L5 Invocation | Overall Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Codex** | ✓ verified | via host agent (OpenCode or Claude) | ⚠️ blocked (env: pydantic-core mismatch) | ✓ bridge verified | ✓ bridge verified | reference in agents/templates/codex_mcp_config.md |
| **OpenCode** | ✓ verified | ✓ host-active verified | ✓ host-active verified | ✓ bridge verified | ✓ bridge verified | repo-tracked config (`opencode.jsonc`) + host-active; cdb_context server connected in OpenCode UI |
| **Claude / Cloud Code** | ✓ verified | template in `agents/templates/claude_mcp.json.template` | needs host-specific test | needs host-specific test | needs host-specific test | template exists; needs host-specific copy to user-level `.mcp.json` |
| **Gemini** | ✓ verified | template in `agents/templates/gemini_mcp_config.yml.template` | needs host-specific test | needs host-specific test | needs host-specific test | template exists; needs host-specific embed in workflow YAML |
| **Onboarding / new agent** | ✓ verified | setup script in `agents/templates/onboarding_mcp_setup.ps1` | ⚠️ blocked (env: pydantic-core mismatch) | ✓ bridge verified | ✓ bridge verified | setup script validates L1/L3/L4/L5; L2 requires manual host config |

**Status key:**
- `✓ verified` — directly confirmed in this repo session
- `✓ repo-tracked config` — actual config file tracked in repo, auto-loaded by agent host
- `✓ host-active verified` — agent host loaded and connected the MCP server (green in host UI)
- `via host agent` — covered by calling agent's MCP config
- `template in ...` — tracked template file; requires manual copy/embed
- `setup script in ...` — executable validation script
- `⚠️ blocked (env)` — local environment dependency conflict (pydantic-core version); not a code defect
- `needs host-specific test` — requires the specific agent host to be running with the config registered

**Validation commands (bridge-level, works regardless of MCP SDK):**

```bash
# Bridge creates successfully — returns tool count
python -c "from tools.mcp.context_bridge import create_bridge; b=create_bridge(); print(len(b.list_tools()))"
# Expected: 26

# Key tool present in inventory
python -c "from tools.mcp.context_bridge import create_bridge; b=create_bridge(); print('context.briefing' in [t['name'] for t in b.list_tools()])"
# Expected: True
```

**Validation command (stdio server import — bounded, does not enter event loop):**

```bash
python -c "import tools.mcp.server; print('STDIO IMPORT OK')"
# If blocked by pydantic-core version mismatch, fix:
# pip install 'pydantic>=2.0,<3.0' 'pydantic-core==2.46.4'
```

> **Note on config naming:** OpenCode's project-level config must be named `opencode.jsonc` or `opencode.json` (no leading dot). The repo tracked config was renamed from `.opencode.jsonc` to `opencode.jsonc` to match this requirement. Pre-existing user-level config at `~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc` is loaded alongside and merged per OpenCode's config precedence rules.
>
> **Note on server naming:** The repo defines server name `cdb_context`. If a user-level or remote config defines a different server named `cdb`, it is a separate server entry. Both coexist in the OpenCode MCP list. The `cdb` (remote) failure shown in OpenCode is pre-existing and unrelated to the repo baseline — it targets `http://127.0.0.1:8812/mcp` and requires a separate MCP server on that port.

**Repo-tracked configs and templates:**

| Surface | File | Type | Location |
|---------|------|------|----------|
| OpenCode | `opencode.jsonc` | repo-tracked config (auto-loaded) | repo root |
| Claude / Cloud Code | `claude_mcp.json.template` | template (copy to user-level `.mcp.json`) | `agents/templates/` |
| Gemini | `gemini_mcp_config.yml.template` | template (embed in workflow YAML) | `agents/templates/` |
| Codex | `codex_mcp_config.md` | reference (no separate MCP surface) | `agents/templates/` |
| Any surface | `onboarding_mcp_setup.ps1` | validation script (run from repo root) | `agents/templates/` |

Run the onboarding script to validate your setup:

```bash
pwsh -File agents/templates/onboarding_mcp_setup.ps1
```

Expected output (best case — bridge + stdio both work):
```
=== CDB Context MCP Capability Validation ===
[L1] Config file exists... PASS
[L2] Host knows config (manual check)... SKIP (manual)
[L3] Bridge and stdio server check... PASS
       Bridge: 26 tools, Stdio import: OK
[L4] context.briefing in tool inventory... PASS
[L5] context.briefing invocation... PASS
=== Results: 4 passed, 0 warnings, 0 failed ===
CDB Context MCP is available.
```

Expected output (bridge works, stdio blocked by env):
```
=== CDB Context MCP Capability Validation ===
[L1] Config file exists... PASS
[L2] Host knows config (manual check)... SKIP (manual)
[L3] Bridge and stdio server check... BRIDGE OK — STDIO BLOCKED
       Bridge: 26 tools, Stdio import: BLOCKED
       STDIO WARN: <error details>
       This is a local environment blocker (pydantic-core version mismatch),
       not a #2619 config defect. Bridge-level tool access works.
       Fix: pip install 'pydantic>=2.0,<3.0' 'pydantic-core==2.46.4'
[L4] context.briefing in tool inventory... PASS
[L5] context.briefing invocation... PASS
=== Results: 4 passed, 1 warnings, 0 failed ===
CDB Context MCP is available (bridge); warnings above.
```

**Capability Resolution Rules (all surfaces):**

When scope includes Context, MCP, SurrealDB, ContextBridge, DB-backed Memory, or Evidence:

1. Run MCP Capability Resolution before planning — verify active tool inventory, not config file presence.
2. If `context.briefing` or required MCP tools are unavailable: stop or explicitly degrade to repo-only.
3. Do not claim DB-backed Brain/Evidence/Memory unless `surrealdb-local` or equivalent DB-backed source is actually available and usable.
4. Non-DB fallback must not report DB-backed `brain_status="used"`.
5. Missing MCP access must be reported as `brain_source=unavailable` or explicit `repo-only` / `brain_status=not-used` fallback.
6. Repo-wide fallback for any surface that cannot verify MCP access: `brain_source=repo-only`, `brain_status=not-used`, repo evidence under `records_or_results`.

---

## 2. Non-Goals (Anti-Criteria)

This runbook explicitly does **not** establish or imply any of the following:

- No production default. The MCP Bridge uses mocked/in-memory adapters (NoopQueryAdapter); no live SurrealDB.
- No write path. All tools are read-only; three-layer defense blocks write attempts.
- No Repo/FS write. Tools do not create, modify, or delete repo files.
- No GitHub action. Tools do not create/close issues, PRs, comments, or trigger workflows.
- No Runtime action. Tools do not execute deploys, docker commands, or environment changes.
- No DB/Memory write. Tools do not write to SurrealDB tables, agent memory, or any persistent store.
- No Live-Readiness change. LR verdict remains **NO-GO** for live trading independent of this runbook.
- No Echtgeld-Go. Wave 12 completion does not authorize real capital.
- No Board-Stage override. `trade-capable` is a Board artefact; it does not authorize live access.

---

## 3. Prerequisites

Required:
- Python 3.12 (matches repo target; see `pyproject.toml`)
- Local repository checkout of `Claire_de_Binare` on a Wave-12 or later commit
- The MCP bridge is pure Python (no compiled dependencies, no system packages)

Not required:
- **Docker is not required.** The default adapter is in-memory (NoopQueryAdapter) and offline.
- **SurrealDB is not required.** The bridge never opens a real network connection.
- **Context Import is optional.** Tools return mocked responses without imported data. For real data, see `surrealdb_context_import.md`.

---

## 4. Bridge Instantiation

```python
from tools.mcp.context_bridge import create_bridge

bridge = create_bridge()
tools = bridge.list_tools()
tool_names = [t["name"] for t in tools]

print(f"Loaded {len(tools)} tools: {', '.join(tool_names)}")
```

The bridge initializes with real handler implementations (not registry stubs) and asserts read-only consistency on construction. All tools return structured dictionaries with `"tool"`, `"status"` (either `"ok"` or `"error"`), and tool-specific fields.

Call a tool:

```python
result = bridge.execute_tool("context.search", {"query": "risk governance"})
print(result["status"])  # "ok" or "error"
```

---

## 5. Available Tools

| Tool | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `context.search` | Full | Search the context knowledge base (keyword + structured queries). Returns results with confidence scores and warnings. |
| `context.trace` | Full | Trace decision or event lineage through the context graph. Returns root node and lineage chain. |
| `context.explain_source` | Full | Resolve provenance for a registered tool or existing repo-relative file path. Repo-/registry-only, deterministic, no DB/network, rejects absolute and traversal paths. |
| `context.package` | Full | Package context artifacts for handoff between agents or sessions. Capped at 10 items. Includes stop conditions. |
| `context.readiness` | Full | Assess agent action readiness for a given task scope. Returns one of 6 readiness status values. Requires task_scope and operation_mode. |
| `context.self_explain` | Full | Generate structured self-explanation for governance-relevant conditions. 9 explanation types supported. |
| `context.briefing` | Full | Generate structured briefing for agent handoff or session start. Delegates to readiness and package handlers. |
| `context.stop_resolver` | Full | Map stop condition strings to resolved severity/action. Handles S1–S10 and H1–H5. |
| `context.required_reads` | Full | Resolve which canonical files an agent must read before starting work. 7-layer resolution. |
| `context.show_snapshot` | Full | Deterministic registry snapshot (tool inventory + read-only flags). No DB/network/GitHub. |
| `context.show_audit` | Full | Deterministic registry audit snapshot for a target tool (schema keys + handler wiring status). No DB/network/GitHub. |

All 11 tools are registered as `read_only: true`. `context.show_snapshot`, `context.show_audit`, and `context.explain_source` are deterministic repo-/registry-only views (no DB-backed trail).

---

## 6. Permission Guardrails (Three-Layer Defense)

The MCP Bridge enforces read-only access through three gates (`#2099`):

### 6.1 Registry Gate
- `ContextToolRegistry.register()` rejects any `ToolDefinition` with `read_only=False`.
- `assert_read_only_consistency()` runs on `ContextBridge.__init__()` to catch post-init tampering.

### 6.2 Execute Gate
- `execute_tool()` validates the tool exists and is read-only before dispatch.
- Non-dict parameters (list, string, int, None) return `invalid_parameters` error without reaching the handler.

### 6.3 Input Gate
- **Scan tools** (free-text parameters scanned for mutation keywords): `context.search`, `context.trace`, `context.explain_source`, `context.package`, `context.show_snapshot`, `context.show_audit`
- **Exempt tools** (structural tools with validated enums, no free-text scan needed): `context.readiness`, `context.briefing`, `context.self_explain`, `context.stop_resolver`, `context.required_reads`

**Blocked keywords** (16 standalone): `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `CREATE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`, `MUTATE`, `REPLACE`, `REMOVE`, `MERGE`, `RELATE`, `DEFINE`, `REBUILD`, `TRUNCATE`, `GRANT`, `REVOKE`

**Blocked query patterns** (14 regexes): e.g. `INSERT INTO`, `UPDATE ... SET`, `CREATE TABLE`

**Blocked runtime operations** (26 strings): e.g. `git_commit`, `git_push`, `docker_build`, `deploy`, `release`, `pr_create`, `issue_create`

Input scanning uses word-boundary regex and recursive parameter walking (dicts and lists). Violations return agent-readable error codes: `forbidden_keyword`, `forbidden_query_pattern`, `forbidden_runtime_operation`.

## 7. Tool Usage Examples

`context.search` and `context.trace` examples below still use mocked/in-memory responses. `context.package`, `context.explain_source`, `context.show_snapshot`, and `context.show_audit` are deterministic repo-/registry-only handlers. For real SurrealDB data, a future Wave will provide a real adapter where applicable.

### 7.1 context.search

```python
result = bridge.execute_tool("context.search", {
    "query": "risk governance decisions",
    "limit": 5,
    "filters": {"source_types": ["decision", "evidence"]}
})
```

Response (ok):
```json
{
    "tool": "context.search",
    "status": "ok",
    "results": [],
    "metadata": {"query_time_ms": 0, "total_hits": 0}
}
```

Error (invalid query):
```json
{
    "tool": "context.search",
    "status": "error",
    "error": {
        "code": "invalid_query",
        "message": "query is required and must be a non-empty string"
    }
}
```

### 7.2 context.trace

```python
result = bridge.execute_tool("context.trace", {
    "target_id": "evt_001",
    "depth": 5
})
```

Response:
```json
{
    "tool": "context.trace",
    "status": "ok",
    "trace": {
        "root": {"id": "evt_001", "type": "unknown", "title": "Mock trace target: evt_001"},
        "lineage": [
            {"id": "mock_related_0", "type": "derived", "relationship": "related_to", "depth": 1},
            {"id": "mock_related_1", "type": "derived", "relationship": "related_to", "depth": 2}
        ]
    }
}
```

Maximum depth is 20. `depth_exceeded` error returned above 20.

### 7.3 context.explain_source

```python
result = bridge.execute_tool("context.explain_source", {
    "source_ref": "context.readiness",
    "include_chain": True
})
```

Supported refs: exact tool name, `tool:<tool-name>`, repo-relative file path, or
`path:<repo-relative-path>`. Prefixes are strict: `tool:` only checks the registry,
`path:` only checks repo files. Unknown refs fail closed with `source_not_found`.
Absolute paths, Windows drive paths, UNC paths, and `..` traversal fail closed with
`invalid_source_ref`. File outputs always use repo-relative paths only.

Response:
```json
{
    "tool": "context.explain_source",
    "status": "ok",
    "explanation": {
        "source_ref": "context.readiness",
        "source_type": "tool",
        "provenance": {

                "warnings"
            ],

            ]
        },
        "source_refs": [
            {"ref": "resolver:registry", "type": "resolver"},
            {"ref": "tool:context.readiness", "type": "tool"}

        "confidence": 1.0,
        "warnings": [],

    },
    "metadata": {
        "include_chain": true,
        "resolution_mode": "repo_registry_only"
    }
}
```

### 7.4 context.package

```python
result = bridge.execute_tool("context.package", {
    "artifacts": [
        "context.readiness",
        "docs/runbooks/surrealdb_context_mcp_access.md"
    ],
    "format": "json",

        }
    }
}
```

Artifacts are capped at 10 items (truncation warning added). Missing/non-list/empty artifacts returns `invalid_artifacts`. The package is repo-/registry-only: it does not read or write SurrealDB, does not create persistent handoff records, and does not imply Live-Go/LR.

### 7.5 context.readiness

**Example: Read-only review:**

```python
result = bridge.execute_tool("context.readiness", {
    "task_scope": "review risk service documentation",
    "operation_mode": "read_only",
    "stop_conditions": ["S10"],
    "required_reads": [
        "AGENTS.md",
        "agents/AGENTS.md",
        "agents/OPEN_CODE_AGENTS.md",
        "docs/runbooks/CONTROL_REGISTER.md",
        "CURRENT_STATUS.md",
        "docs/live-readiness/LR-AUDIT-STATUS-2026-03-05.md"
    ]
})
```

Response:
```json
{
    "tool": "context.readiness",
    "status": "ok",
    "readiness": {
        "status": "ready_for_read_only",
        "reasons": ["Read-only scope, no writes required."],
        "required_next_reads": [],
        "human_go_required": false,
        "stop_conditions": ["S10"],
        "missing_context": [],
        "missing_evidence": [],
        "scope_drift_findings": [],
        "uncertainties": [],
        "guardrails": [
            "No writes. No issue comments. No PR creation.",
            "Readiness is not authorization. LR remains NO-GO. Board stage (trade-capable) is orthogonal."
        ]
    }
}
```

**Example: Write without evidence:**

```python
result = bridge.execute_tool("context.readiness", {
    "task_scope": "fix order handler precision bug",
    "operation_mode": "write (code/docs)",
    "target_paths": ["services/execution/order_handler.py"],
    "required_reads": [
        "AGENTS.md", "agents/AGENTS.md", "agents/OPEN_CODE_AGENTS.md",
        "docs/runbooks/CONTROL_REGISTER.md", "CURRENT_STATUS.md",
        "docs/live-readiness/LR-AUDIT-STATUS-2026-03-05.md"
    ],
    "impact_refs": ["services/execution/", "services/risk/"],
    "evidence_refs": [],  # Missing evidence
    "stop_conditions": ["S7: execution scope"]

### 7.6 context.briefing

```python
result = bridge.execute_tool("context.briefing", {
    "task_id": "task_review_001",
    "target_issue": None,
    "task_scope": "review risk governance documentation",
    "requested_depth": "quick",
    "operation_mode": "read_only"
})
```

Response includes `briefing_id` (16-char hex, deterministic), `scope_summary`, `required_reads`, `guardrails` (7 mandatory), `stop_conditions`, `validation_plan`, `human_go_required`. Depths: `quick` (summary only), `standard` (with artifacts), `deep` (with mock uncertainty warnings).

`briefing.session_context` is the canonical short-term/session-memory handoff surface for Context/MCP work. It is always `working_memory` with `session_only=true`, remains read-only, and must not be treated as persistent SurrealDB memory. DB-backed Brain or evidence claims require both `brain_source="surrealdb-local"` and a usable `brain_status` (`used` or `partial`). `blocked`, `not-used`, `repo-only`, `in_memory`, and `unavailable` stay fail-closed.

Deterministic example with explicit session context inputs:

```python
result = bridge.execute_tool("context.briefing", {
    "task_id": "task_review_2607",
    "target_issue": "#2607",
    "task_scope": "review session-context handoff behavior",
    "requested_depth": "quick",
    "operation_mode": "read_only",
    "brain_source": "repo-only",
    "brain_status": "not-used",
    "repo_state": {
        "branch": "fix/2613-noise-freeze-remaining-push-triggers",
        "commit": "f345cf0c",
        "working_tree": "dirty"
    },
    "github_state": {
        "target_issue": "#2607",
        "related_prs": [],
        "open_epics": ["#2607"]
    },
    "working_assumptions": [
        "repo-only verification is sufficient for this handoff"
    ]
})
```

Expected abbreviated output:

```json
{
  "tool": "context.briefing",
  "status": "ok",
  "briefing": {
    "session_context": {
      "memory_type": "working_memory",
      "session_only": true,
      "ttl_seconds": 14400,
      "brain_source": "repo-only",
      "brain_status": "not-used",
      "repo_state": {
        "branch": "fix/2613-noise-freeze-remaining-push-triggers",
        "commit": "f345cf0c",
        "working_tree": "dirty"
      },
      "github_state": {
        "target_issue": "#2607",
        "related_prs": [],
        "open_epics": ["#2607"]
      },
      "agent_operating_mode": {
        "operation_mode": "read_only",
        "human_go_required": false,
        "db_claims_allowed": false
      },
      "working_assumptions": [
        "repo-only verification is sufficient for this handoff"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Brain Evidence mapping from `briefing.session_context`:

- `brain_source <- briefing.session_context.brain_source`
- `brain_status <- briefing.session_context.brain_status`
- `tools_or_queries <- caller-provided MCP/tool reads or, if absent, conservative session limitations`
- `records_or_results <- briefing.session_context.repo_state + briefing.session_context.github_state`
- `repo_crosscheck <- briefing.session_context.repo_state + briefing.required_reads + request target paths/symbols when present`
- `impact_on_plan <- briefing.session_context.working_assumptions + briefing.session_context.limitations`
- `limitations <- briefing.session_context.limitations`

Canonical Brain Evidence block derived from the example above:

```text
## Brain Evidence
brain_source: repo-only
brain_status: not-used
tools_or_queries:
  - context.briefing(task_review_2607)
  - repo-only verification is sufficient for this handoff
records_or_results:
  - branch=fix/2613-noise-freeze-remaining-push-triggers
  - commit=f345cf0c
  - working_tree=dirty
  - target_issue=#2607
  - related_prs=[]
  - open_epics=[#2607]
repo_crosscheck:
  - briefing.required_reads
  - branch=fix/2613-noise-freeze-remaining-push-triggers
  - commit=f345cf0c
impact_on_plan:
  - repo-only verification is sufficient for this handoff
  - repo-only brain source; no DB-backed memory or evidence claims
limitations:
  - repo-only brain source; no DB-backed memory or evidence claims
```

### #2607 Short-Term Session Context Acceptance

- Structured `session_context` preserves `branch`, `commit`, and `working_tree` when caller-provided.
- Issue/PR state can be handed off through `github_state` (`target_issue`, `related_prs`, `open_epics`).
- `working_assumptions` are temporary session hints only because `session_only=true`.
- `ttl_seconds` is bounded to `<= 14400` (4h) for this MCP handoff surface.
- `repo-only` and `in_memory` are not DB-backed and must keep `db_claims_allowed=false`.
- Persistent Brain or memory claims require `brain_source=surrealdb-local` and usable `brain_status` (`used` or `partial`); `blocked` always disables DB-backed claims.
- `session_context` does not authorize any automatic long-term memory write or persistent DB write.
- A full Brain Evidence block can be generated from `briefing.session_context` plus the sibling briefing fields such as `required_reads`.

### 7.7 context.stop_resolver

```python
result = bridge.execute_tool("context.stop_resolver", {
    "stop_conditions": ["S7", "S8"],
    "operation_mode": "write (code/docs)"
})
```

Resolved entries include `type`, `severity` (`warning`/`blocking`), `reason`, `required_action`, `human_go_required`. S7 severity depends on operation mode.

### 7.8 context.required_reads

```python
result = bridge.execute_tool("context.required_reads", {
    "task_scope": "review risk limits",
    "target_issue": None,
    "operation_mode": "read_only"
})
```

Resolves through 7 layers: minimum baseline, domain-specific, issue-driven, path-driven, symbol-driven, concept-driven, and write-mode governance reads. Each resolved read has `path`, `priority` (`must_read`, `should_read`, `may_read`), `reason`, `source_ref`, `available`, and optional `warning`.

## 8. Readiness Check Deep Dive

### 8.1 Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `ready_for_read_only` | Agent may read files, search code, and analyze context. No writes of any kind are permitted. |
| `ready_for_dry_run` | Agent may simulate, plan, diff, or generate previews. No write without explicit Human-GO. |
| `ready_for_human_go` | Agent has sufficient context to proceed but MUST stop and request explicit Human-GO before any write. |
| `blocked_missing_context` | Execution blocked. One or more required inputs are missing. |
| `blocked_missing_evidence` | Execution blocked. One or more core assumptions lack committed evidence. |
| `blocked_scope_drift` | Execution blocked. Requested task diverges from defined scope or scope is ambiguous. |

Status derivation is deterministic: same inputs produce same status.

### 8.2 Operation Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `read_only` | Read files, search code, analyze context. No writes. |
| `dry_run` | Plan, simulate, preview. No writes without Human-GO. |
| `write (code/docs)` | Write to repo files (documentation, test code). |
| `write (config/infra)` | Write configuration or infrastructure files. |
| `write (DB/migration)` | Write database migrations or DB state. |
| `write (MCP live)` | Live MCP action (e.g. PR creation, issue comment). |

Invalid or missing `operation_mode` returns `blocked_missing_context`. Any `write` mode sets `human_go_required: true`.

### 8.3 Minimum Required Reads

Every readiness assessment requires these files present:
- `AGENTS.md`
- `agents/AGENTS.md`
- `agents/OPEN_CODE_AGENTS.md`
- `docs/runbooks/CONTROL_REGISTER.md`
- `CURRENT_STATUS.md`
- `docs/live-readiness/LR-AUDIT-STATUS-2026-03-05.md`

Missing any of these produces `blocked_missing_context` with specific stop conditions.

---

## 9. Stop Conditions and Human-GO

### 9.1 Stop Conditions (S1–S10)

| Code | Severity | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| S1 | blocking | Task scope is missing, empty, or ambiguous. |
| S2 | blocking | No Context Package and no required reads. |
| S3 | blocking | One or more minimum required reads are unavailable. |
| S4 | blocking | Core assumptions lack evidence. |
| S5 | blocking | Scope does not match defined targets. |
| S6 | blocking | Write operation without impact report. |
| S7 | blocking (write) / warning (read_only) | Task touches trading/risk/execution surface. |
| S8 | blocking | Live/Echtgeld/production claims outside LR SSOT. |
| S9 | warning | Contradiction risk — conflicting evidence or signals. |
| S10 | warning | STOP signal encountered in canonical control surfaces. |

### 9.2 Human-GO Rules (H1–H5)

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| H1 | Any `write` operation mode requires Human-GO. |
| H2 | Runtime surface touched (docker, deploy, secrets). |
| H3 | Secrets rotation or write. |
| H4 | GitHub control-plane mutation (PR merge, issue close). |
| H5 | Trading/risk/execution state change. |

Even when `status: ready_for_human_go`, the agent MUST stop and wait for explicit human approval. Readiness is not authorization.

## 10. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Error Code | Cause | Action |
|---------|------------|-------|--------|
| `"unknown_tool"` | `unknown_tool` | Tool name not in registry | Check spelling. Use `bridge.list_tool_names()`. |
| `"not_implemented"` | `not_implemented` | Tool handler scaffold placeholder | The target tool is still wired to a scaffold handler. Use `context.show_audit` to audit `handler_status` and confirm wiring, then stop and report which tool remains stubbed. |
| `"invalid_query"` | `invalid_query` | Missing, empty, or non-string query | Provide a non-empty string in the `query` field. |
| `"invalid_artifacts"` | `invalid_artifacts` | Missing or non-list artifacts | Provide a non-empty list of artifact ID strings. |
| `"invalid_parameters"` | `invalid_parameters` | Parameters not a dict | Pass parameters as `dict`, not list/string/int. |
| `"forbidden_keyword"` | `forbidden_keyword` | SQL/SurrealQL mutation keyword in query params | Remove INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc. from query text. |
| `"forbidden_query_pattern"` | `forbidden_query_pattern` | Mutation query pattern detected | Remove SQL/SurrealQL write statements from parameters. |
| `"forbidden_runtime_operation"` | `forbidden_runtime_operation` | Runtime operation keyword in query tool params | Avoid git/docker/deploy keywords in scan-tool parameters. |
| `"blocked_missing_context"` | (readiness check) | Missing required inputs | Add missing required_reads, stop_conditions, or impact_refs. |
| `"blocked_scope_drift"` | (readiness check) | Task scope diverges from targets | Narrow scope or update stop conditions. |
| `"blocked_missing_evidence"` | (readiness check) | Write operation without evidence_refs | Supply evidence references before proceeding. |

## 12. Clearances and Verdict

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| LR Verdict | **NO-GO** (unchanged) |
| Board Stage | `trade-capable` (orthogonal) |
| Echtgeld | Not authorized |
| Write Path | Disabled (three-layer defense) |
| Runtime/MCP Live | Not authorized |
| Memory Write | Not authorized |

---

## 13. Closing Reminder

- All examples use **mocked/in-memory responses**. No real SurrealDB is contacted.
- The three-layer defense (Registry + Execute + Input gates) blocks writes at every level.
- The bridge returns **fail-closed**: invalid input returns `status: "error"` with an agent-readable error code.
- Live-Readiness remains **NO-GO**. Wave 12 completion does not change Echtgeld posture.
- `ready_for_human_go` is a status, not a permission. Agents MUST stop and wait for explicit Human-GO.
